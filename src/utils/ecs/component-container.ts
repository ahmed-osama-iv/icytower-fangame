/**
 * This custom container is so that calling code can provide the
 * Component *instance* when adding (e.g., add(new Position(...))), and
 * provide the Component *class* otherwise (e.g., get(Position),
 * has(Position), delete(Position)).
 *
 * We also use two different types to refer to the Component's class:
 * `Function` and `ComponentClass<T>`. We use `Function` in most cases
 * because it is simpler to write. We use `ComponentClass<T>` in the
 * `get()` method, when we want TypeScript to know the type of the
 * instance that is returned. Just think of these both as referring to
 * the same thing: the underlying class of the Component.
 *
 * You might notice a footgun here: code that gets this object can
 * directly modify the Components inside (with add(...) and delete(...)).
 * This would screw up our ECS bookkeeping of mapping Systems to
 * Entities! We'll fix this later by only returning callers a view onto
 * the Components that can't change them.
